Complete Battlebit recoil compensation

Uses the same concepts for hardware mouse injection as [Cezium](https://github.com/StrateimTech/Cezium)

# Features
* Supports all types of weapon configurations along with scopes. (- Semi/burst guns)

# Cons
* Doesn't support horizontal recoil compensation
* Doesn't support burst & single fire modes

# How-to
For best recoil compensation you'll want to make a weapon setup with the least amount of horizontal recoil at the sacrifice of vertical recoil.
